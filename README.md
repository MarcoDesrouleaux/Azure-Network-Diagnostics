# How to Connect 2 Virtual Machines Together Using Microsoft Azure

## Introduction
This guide demonstrates how to connect two virtual machines (VMs) together within Microsoft Azure. By following this tutorial, you'll learn to create and connect VMs, enabling secure communication between them.

## Prerequisites
- An active Microsoft Azure account
- Basic understanding of virtual machines and networking

## Step 1: Sign in to Azure Portal
1. Open your browser and navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Enter your email address and password to sign in.

## Step 2: Setting Up the First Virtual Machine
1. Create a resource group.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Second Virtual Machine
### 2.1 Provide Basic Information for the Basics page
## Project details 
1. Select the appropriate Subscription.
2. Create or select an existing 'Resource Group. For this example: we will select "Azure-Lab-1".
## Instance details
3. Enter a name for your virtual machine. For this example: We will name it "VM2".
4. Choose a region closest to your location. For this example: We will select "(US) North Central US".
5. Choose the Virtual Machine Image. For the example: We will select "Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS - x64 Gen2".
6.  Select the desired 'Size' for your virtual machine. For the example: We will select "Standard_E2s_v3 - 2 vcpus, 16 GiB memory ($91.98/month)".
## Administrator account
7. Select "Password" instead of using SSH public key.
8. For the 2nd virtual machine: Use the same "Username & Password" you used for the 1st virtual machine you created. (If you forget the password, you will have to delete and create another VM.)

### 2.4 Review & Create a Virtual Machine
1. Once it starts validating the information to see if everything is clear, you will see "Validation Passed" on the left side of the screen. Then you can proceed to create the virtual machine.

2. Once you click the "Create button", you will see "Your deployment is complete". That is when your virtual machine will be created.

## Step 3: Configuring Networking Between VMs (We will use Remote Desktop for Windows) 
## Side Note: MacOS Users have to download the "Microsoft Remote Desktop" on the App Store.

### 3.3 Connecting VMs
<br>1. On the Virtual Machines page, click on VM1.

<br>3. Once copied, click on the start menu and look for "Remote Desktop Connection" and open it.
<br>4. Paste it on where it says "Computer" then click the "Connect button".

<br>5. Enter the credentials you used when you created VM1.
<br>6. For this example: We will use the username "Azureuser" with the password I chose earlier to create VM1.

## Step 4: Testing the Connection
1. Connect to the first VM through SSH or Remote Desktop.
2. Use `ping` or other networking tools to test the connection to the second VM.

## Conclusion
You have successfully connected two virtual machines together in Microsoft Azure. This setup allows for secure communication between VMs and serves as a foundation for more complex networking scenarios.
